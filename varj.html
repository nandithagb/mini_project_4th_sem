    <p>*CSH- 5: This grows to a height of 5 to 6 ft. The grains are not spoiled even when earhead affected in rains at the time of harvest.<br>
      *CSV- 4: This also grows to a height of 5 to 6 ft.<br>
     *High yields are possible only with timely sowing and application of adequate dose of fertilizers.<br>
      *Since the plants will be green even at the time of harvest can be used for fodder.<br> </p>
