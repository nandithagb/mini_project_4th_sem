<h1>PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<h2>Irrigated ragi production techniques</h2>
An area of about 1.50 gunte (25 ft. length x 4 ft. width x 4 ft. height) totally 15 nursery beds has to be prepared/acre.<br>
Apply 50 kg FYM, 7.5 kg Ammonium Sulphate, 50 kg super phosphate and 7.5 kg murrate of Potash fertilizers with 300 g. zinc sulphate before sowing and mix equally for all nursery beds.<br>
Seed treatment to ragi seeds with Azospirillum (400 g.) bio.fertilizer before sowing.<br>
Sow 2 kg seeds to all nursery beds equally in 3''rows.<br>
Close the nursery beds with powdered soil or fine FYM and provide watering every day evening.<br>
Top dress the crop with 4 kg urea at 10 - 12 days after sowing.<br>
Seedlings will be ready for transplanting at 18 - 21 days after sowing.<br>
Use short duration varieties 18 - 20 days and other varieties 22 - 25 day's old seedlings for transplanting.<br>
Apply of 20 kg Nitrogen, 20 kg Super Phosphate and 20 kg Potash fertilizers to the soil at 9''rows.<br>
Transplanting of seedlings, long duration varieties at 6''and medium duration varieties at 4"of intra row spacing with 2. 3 seedlings /hill.<br>
For the control of weeds, spray 0.6 liters Butachlor 50% EC with 300 liters of water/ acre.<br>
After planting, if the water standing thinly in the soil, application of 0.6 liters Butachlor 50% EC mixes with 30 kg sand and broadcast to all parts of the field.<br>
Irrigate the crop 8 days interval in red soils and 15 days interval in black soils.<br>
Top dress the crop with nitrogen 20 kg. at 30 days after planting.<br>

            <h2> Ragi nursery beds</h2>
<h2>Rainfed ragi production techniques</h2>
Before sowing one deep ploughing, two light ploughings followed by harrowing.<br>
Apply 3 t. FYM manure at last ploughing.<br>
Before sowing seed treatment with 13 g. Zinc sulphate and 10 g. Carbondizim/acre.<br>
Sowing of seeds by using seed. cum. fertilizer drills at 12''rows.<br>
If planting has to be done, plant the seedlings at 1 ft. rows and 4''intra rows with 2 - 3 seedlings/ hill.<br>
Apply 50% Nitrogen and entire Phosphorous and potash recommended dose of fertilizers.<br>
Apply 5 kg zinc Sulphate and 4 kg Borax to the soil before sowing.<br>
Intercultivation after 15 days of sowing, 2 - 3 times at 10 days interval.<br>
Top dress the crop with 10 kg Nitrogen fertilizers at 6 - 7 weeks after sowing.<br>
Follow the remaining steps as suggested in irrigated ragi.<br>
For control of weeds, spray 300 g. Isoproturon 75% WP mixes in 300 liters.<br>
      Plant protection: Follow the recomandations of irrigated ragi to rainfed ragi.<br>
