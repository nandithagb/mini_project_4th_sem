    <h1>  Sustainable paddy production through integrated nutrient management (INM)</h1>
<p>In Karnataka Cauvery water shed areas, the soils are sand mixed with clay particles hence the available nutrients to the crops are low.<br>
  Also these areas only single cropping is practicing. FYM/ compost and green manure application is very limited hence the soil health is degrading day by day.<br>
  Under these circumstances in order to obtain sustainable paddy yield soil health management is very important.<br>
  Based on soil fertility and production, INM study was taken at Zonal Agricultural Research Station V.C. farm Mandya for longer period of 15 yrs and drawn conclusions.<br></p>
  <h2>  Use of different organic manures based on its nutrients available for paddy cultivation</h2>

  <p>Based on above table data, 10 ton FYM or 5 t. green leaf manure fertilizers application can save 50% of nutrients through organic manure.<br>
    Out of total nutrients, application of 50% of in-organic fertilizers, nitrogen, super phosphate and potassium and remaining 50% nutrients through organic manures application can sustain the paddy yield.<br>
    Application of I.N.M during first 4 - 5 yrs period as per recommendation though average yield obtained, after 5 yrs the yield was increased significantly as per the research findings.<br>
    Through I.N.M management, the yield and soil health improvement is observed.<br>
    About 2 times higher net profit is obtained, hence the famers can use the available organic manures based on following nutrients              application to the paddy cultivation<br>
    1. Apply 4 t. of FYM to the soil before transplanting and followed by ploughing and application of 20 kg nitrogen, 10 kg phosphorus and 10 kg potash, in-organic fertilizers per acre.<br>
    2.Application of green manure crops like chambe, sesbania, pongemia leaves etc. 2 t. to the soil, allow 2 - 3 weeks for decomposition and then apply 20 kg nitrogen, 10 kg phosphorous and 10 kg potash, in-organic fertilizers per acre.<br>
    3.If FYM/compost and green manure fertilizers availability is not adequately available, apply 2 t. FYM/compost to the green manure crops growing plots. After 45 - 50 days of green manure crops are to be incorporated into the soil by ploughing.  2 -3 weeks after its decomposition in the soil apply 20 kg nitrogen, 10 kg phosphorous and 10 kg potash in-organic fertilizers per acre.<br>
