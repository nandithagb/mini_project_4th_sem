            The Indian economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and the livelihood of the Indian farmer largely depends on the Monsoon rains. <br>If figures are to be believed, 70 per cent of the Indian population depends on farming, either directly or indirectly. <br>Around 58 per cent of the total employment in the country is through agriculture. <br>Also, the agricultural sector in our country contributes to around 18 per cent of the GDP.<br>

Southwest Monsoon in India is a four month long affair from June till September. <br>More than 75 per cent of India’s annual rainfall occurs during this period itself.<br>The fate of the Kharif crops depend on the performance of the southwest Monsoon.<br> Good rains during the season result in bountiful crops which further benefit the farmers.<br>

A major portion of the country’s crop area is completely dependent on Monsoon rains as they’re not equipped with methods of manual irrigation.<br>Simply speaking, the Indian economy gains due to good Monsoon rains in the country.<br> On the other hand, weak Monsoon rains result in crop failure which affects the economy in a negative manner due to lower production.<br> Later on, this translates into price-rise, low industrial output, and other issues.<br>
