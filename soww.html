    <h1>Sowing<br>
      Wheat Irrigated: Sow the seed in 7'' rows not deeper than 2''.</h1>
      <p>
        <h2><B>Methods of sowing</B></h2>

Wheat is sown by the following methods-<br>

<h2><B>1) Broadcasting:</B></h2>  <br>

This method is as old as agriculture itself but it has several draw backs viz. all seeds do not get better soil moisture contact and do not germinate, a part of the seed is eaten up by birds and ants etc., which results in uneven and poor germination. Thus, If needs abut 25 per cent higher seed over the recommended one.<br>

<h2><B>2) Sowing in furrows:</B></h2><br>

After proper seed bed preparation the seed is dropped in furrows behind the country plough by hand (Kerri method). Some times a funnel attached with an iron pipe in the hand of plough (pora/nai method) and the seed is dropped at desired depth and spacing for obtaining satisfactory germination<br>

<h2><B>3) Dibbling:</B></h2><br>

The method was popularized during early sixties and proved under limited seed availability however, being time taking cumbersive and labour intensive it could not be commercialized.<br>

<h2><B>4) Drilling:</B></h2><br>

The sowing is done through seed drills/seed cum fertilizer drill and it has gained popularity.  In this way the seeds droped at uniform depth and results in uniform germination and regular stand.<br>

<h2><B>5) Zero-Till Seed Drill (ZTSD):</B></h2>

 The ZTSD was developed by G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology for rice-wheat cropping system zones, which is used for sowing of wheat seed and in rice stubbles immediately after harvest of rice, to utilized the residual soil moisture and reduce the period, otherwise required for seed bed preparation. It is now gaining popularity as it results in nearly equal productivity as obtained by conventional method of sowing done about a fortnight earlier. For grater advantage the established weeds must be removed and bunds prepared in the field should be broken.

 <h2><B>6) Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed (FIRB):</B></h2>

 This method has been evolved to economize irrigation water in which raised beds of prepared to accommodate 2 or 3 rows of wheat between two furrows. The irrigation is done only in furrows. Thus about half of the irrigation required may be saved by this method without any loss to the productivity of wheat grain. The wheat yield has been found to be higher then conventional method at Directorate of Wheat Research (DWR), Karnal. A machine has been developed to make raised bed and sowing of wheat simultaneously has been developed for this purpose. This method helps in economizing water required by the crop besides giving better germination.
