    <p><h3><B>Land preparation:</B></h3><br>
      Deep ploughing two times followed by harrowing, apply 4 t. of well decomposed FYM to the soil and level by passing halube.
      <h3><B>Sowing and method</B></h3><br>
   Use 3 kg seed/ acre (dibbling), 8 - 10 kg (drill sowing).<br>
   Based on fertility of the soil draw rows at 1 ft. apart by using seed drill.<br>
   Dibbling of 2 seeds at 1 ft. intra row spacing of 2"depth.<br>
   In dry lands if the irrigation is not given after sowing, provide irrigation after 3 days otherwise the germination gets affected.<br>
   Provide irrigation at every 5 days interval.<br>
   <h3><B>Nutrients</B></h3><br>
   40 kg nitrogen, 20 kg phosphorous and 20 kg potash/ acre.<br>
   Application of 50% (20 kg) nitrogen and phosphorous (10 kg) and entire potash (20 kg) fertilizers at the time of sowing.<br>
   Application of 25% nitrogen (10 kg) and 50% potash (10 kg) at 30 days after sowing as topdressing.<br>
   Remaining 25% nitrogen (10 kg) after 1 month interval as topdressing.<br>
   Based on fertility status of the soil, after 35 - 40 days of interval if the crop shows deficiency symptoms of iron and zinc i.e. yellowing of leaves, spray multiplex (10 ml. / ltr of water) there by deficiency can be managed.<br>
   <h3><B>Water management</B></h3><br>
     Irrigate the crop at 5 days interval till the crop gets matured. Between 75 - 110 days interval after sowing maintain moisture content in     the soil, if not the panicle get Chaffey.<br>
     <h3><B>Critical stages of water</B></h3><br>
    I.            Germination period.<br>
    II.           Tillering stage.<br>
   III.            Flowering to grain filling stage.<br>
   In the above said periods maintain optimum moisture level in the soil.<br>
   <h3><B>Weed management</B></h3><br>
   On the day of the sowing or next day spray 10% Pyrozosulpuron ethyl 100 g. Powder or Oxyflorofen 23.5 E.C. 160 ml. in 300 litres of water on soil and move it backwards.<br>
   There should be optimum soil moisture at the time of spraying and avoid more of clods.<br>
   Control weeds which are transmitted through seeds if the concentration of the chemical increases there will be decrease in germination.<br>
   If weed infestation is high after 40 - 50 days of sowing, take up one hand weeding.<br>
   <h3><B>Inter cultivation</B></h3><br>
   Passing harrowing three times after 15 - 20 days intervals of sowing can controlled the weeds fully.<br>
   By attending deep intercultivation at every 12 - 15 days interval not only controls the weeds provide easy movement of air in the soil there by enhance the strong root growth and higher tillers.<br>
   Intercultivation in this aerobic method will loosen the soil and enhance the water holding capacity.<br>
   In this method the movement of air is high and lesser the moisture content hence occurrence of pest and diseases is less.<br>
   <h3><B>Plant protection:</B></h3> Follow the recommendations of irrigated paddy.<br>
   <h3>Advantages of SRI method of paddy cultivation</h3><br>
   Direct seed sowing.<br>
   Not required puddling, seedling production and transplanting.<br>
   Medium duration varieties.<br>
   Higher number of tillers and less lodging<br>.
   80% saving in seeds (3 kg. /acre).<br>
   30% labour saving.<br>
   Cultivation and time saving.<br>
   40 - 50% water saving and effective utilization.<br>
   Tolerant to drought and stress conditions.<br>
   Improvement in soil particles.<br>
   Effective utilization of inorganic fertilizers.<br>
   Increase the number of tillers.<br>
   Due to non puddling production of methane gas is very low their by environmental pollution is reduced.<br>
   Mosquito control is possible.<br>

    <h3><B>Irrigated Paddy</B></h3>
    <h3><B> II.Winter season paddy nursery management</B></h3>
Cover the transparent polyethylene sheet (300 gages) on sown nursery beds above 15 days in winter season will control the cold problem.<br>
Above the nursery bed, place the polyethylene sheet laminated with a height of about 18" so that it protects the wind. Fifteen days after the polyethylene sheet is removed to allow the plants to grow in a natural way.<br>
<h3><B>III.Land preparation</B></h3><br>
1. 2 - 3 times land ploughing and levelling.<br>
2. Apply 2 t. FYM or compost/acre to the soil 3 weeks before planting.<br>
3. Sowing of green manure crops like Sesbania or Daincha during May - June months in paddy growing plots and incorporate<br>         
4. Apply 4 t. leaf and stem to be incorporated into the soil and it should be done 3 weeks before planting.<br>
5. Care should be taken to stop the movement of water from one plot to another plot.<br>
6. In saline soils areas open the drains to dry out the stagnated water.<br>
7. In malnad areas, incorporate 1 kg Chromolenia green leaf/ sqm, at the time of planting or one day before planting.<br>
8. In coastal and malnad alkaline soils apply lime@ 200 kg. /acre (calcium hydroxide) 2 days before planting or 3 weeks <br>                   
calcium carbonate to the soil.<br>

 <h3><B>V. Bio - fertilizers</B></h3><br>
Use of Azospyrillum<br><br>
Azospyrillum can be used in temperate areas for crops like paddy, sugarcane, jowar, bajra, ragi and other minor millets fixation of nitrogen in the root system of plants, which live on the outskirts.<br>
In addition to available of nitrogen fertilizer directly to the crops, in Azospyrillum toxins or harmones produced in this will enhance the plants growth.<br>
 <h4>Method of using Azospyrillum fertilizersby 3 methods</h4><br>
400 g. of Azospyrillum bio - fertilizer seed treatment for every acre seed required.<br>    
Application of 800 g. of bio-fertilizer directly to the seed beds or transplanting plots.<br>     
Root dipping of paddy seedlings in 400 g. Azospyrillum bio-fertilizer solution followed by transplanting.<br>
<h3><B> Method</B></h3><br>
1.Seed treatment (direct seeding)<br><br>
50 g. of jaggery or sugar in half a litre of water and boil for 5 minutes to produce sticky solution.<br>
Jaggery or sugar solution applied evenly over the seed, then the organic fertilizer (400 g.), mix and then dried in the shade for half an hour to use in nursery beds.<br>
2. Use in transplanted areas
800 g. Azospyrillum bio-fertilizer mix with 10 kg fine FYM and 10 kg soil, then mix it and then mixed with manure and broadcast the transplanting plots.<br>
3.Seedling root dip method<br>
Open a small pond of size 6 ft. long and 6 ft. wide, allow 4"water depth.
Apply 400 g. Azospyrillum bio-fertilizer and mix in the water and dip the seedlings taken from nursery for 10 - 15 minutes and then take up transplanting.<br>
<h3><B>VI.Transplanting and topdressing</B></h3>
Use 20 - 25 days old healthy seedlings for transplanting.
Before transplanting apply of 50% nitrogen, entire phosphorous and 50% potash to the soil.
Transplant the seedlings at 8"rows and 4"intra rows spacing, planting 2 - 3 seedlings/ hill at 2"depth approximately (figure- 3) shows the effects of deeper planting.<br>


If not possible planting in rows, 50 hills/ sqm 2 - 3 seedlings per hill may be transplanted this is applicable to all the varieties except Pushpa and Mangala,in these varieties 67 hills /sqm at 2 - 3 seedlings/ hill,in hybrid paddy varieties one seedling/ hill.<br>
1. Apply 800 g. Bacillus megaterium of phosphorous solubilising bacteria fertilizers mixing with 4 kg fine FYM and 4 kg soil and broadcast to the field 6 - 8  days after planting.<br>
2. Apply 25% nitrogen after 25 - 30 days of planting as topdressing.
3. Remaining 25% nitrogen along with 50% potash fertilizers are applied during panicle initiation period or 25 days before flowering as topdressing.<br>
4. Drain out the water in plots before applying fertilizers.<br>
5. In Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mandya and Mysore districts apply 50% phosphorous fertilizers at planting and give remaining 50% after 3 - 4 weeks.
6. If neem coated urea is used, only 75% of the nitrogen may be applied at the time of transplanting.<br>
7. In coastal areas, before transplanting provide (1/ 3) part of nitrogen and entire phosphorous and 50% potash fertilizers to the soil.<br>
8. Transplant the seedlings at 8"rows and 4"intra row spacing with 2 - 3 seedlings/hill.<br>
9. In case of Jyothi and Mahaveera varieties, 6"rows and 4"intra row spacing with 2 - 3 seedlings/ hill.<br>
10. Apply (1/ 3) part nitrogen fertilizer after 25 - 30 days of planting as topdressing.<br>
11. Apply (1/ 3) part nitrogen and 50% potash as topdressing at 25 days after planting.<br>
  Preparation of urea mixed clay<br>
If use urea as topdressing made moderate use and provide in two splits, one at 15 days after planting, another at before ear head emergence.<br>
Mix 10 kg urea with 50 - 100 kg clay soil and sprinkle water for light moisture and keep it for 24 hrs.<br>
Drain out the water in the plots and broadcast the urea mixed clay and allow water after 24 hrs.<br>
VII. Use of zinc sulphate<br>
Apply 8 kg zinc sulphate to the soil for every 3 crop seasons.<br>
If zinc deficiency noticed, spray 1% zinc sulphate at 3 weeks after transplanting.<br>
<h3><B>VIII. Irrigation and intercultivation</B></h3><br>
Provide 1"irrigation for first 10 days after planting and after infiltration of 1"irrigation provide 2"irrigation up to 10 days of before harvesting.<br>
Maintain 1"water level before 10 days of harvesting and further stop irrigation.<br>
Tillering, earhead emergence periods are the important critical stages in paddy. Maintain the water level in these periods is important.<br>
Cracks will be developed, when the moisture is less, about 8 - 10% reduction in the yield.<br>
Provide irrigation if noticed small cracks due to water shortage areas.<br>
Pass the cono-rotary-weeder in between rows at 2, 7 and 9 weeks after planting.<br>
<h3><B>IX. Total water requirement</B></h3><br>
Kharif transplanted paddy (52 lakh litre of water) required 2.5% more water than punaji paddy (20 lakh litre of water).<br>
Transplanted paddy required more water than any of the other crops.<br>
If allow to stand water regularly in pathis, 50% of water (26 lakh litre of water) get infiltrated into the soil.<br>
Farmers interested in growing paddy are advised to go for punaji paddy cultivation there by 50% water can be save.<br>
Though punaji paddy gives lesser yield, the water is very good in terms of savings.<br>
Though the punaji method of paddy gives lesser yield, keeping the importance of water savings, the farmers under tank bed achukatt areas can get water available to all farmers. <br>
