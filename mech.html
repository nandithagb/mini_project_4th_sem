      <h1><B> Mechanization in paddy cultivation</B></h1>
In paddy cultivation total percentage of labour cost towards different major operations are, 11% for puddling, 38% for seedlings transplanting, 19% for weed control, 20% for harvesting and 12% for post harvesting operations.<br>
To reduce the labour requirement and cultivation expenditure mechanization is more suitable.<br>
Paddy transplanting machine: The seedlings raised in mat type nursery are suitable for planting in puddle plots with the use of this paddy transplanter in appropriate time, and also save labour requirement.<br>
<br>
